# 3D view with aerial photographies

## Context
This project was completed within a 3D course at the [ENSG](http://www.ensg.eu/). This project was requested by the IGN and thet goal of is to visualize aerial photographies in a 3D map according to their orientation. This project aims to give the impression of a 3D rendering without using 3D data and only 3D images.

The user can rotate about a specific point.

He can also display cameras by checking a box in the right side of the interface. He can now see where cameras are located.

Two main objectives were determined :
- fetch and render images from a IGN database. All images displaying a specific point must be fetched and displayed.
- find the image taken with the camera with the most appropriate point of view compared to the user point of view to display this image preferably

The working example `index.html` is in the `examples` folder. Moreover, it can be found at :  http://lucasdemassy.github.io/3D-view-with-aerial-photographies/examples/ 

## Images
Currently, the images 8, 9, and 10 have a very low resolution and have to be changed.

The four images currently used (photo7.jpg, photo8.jpg, photo9.jpg, photo10.jpg) have their orientation in alegoria.json at the position 7, 8, 9, 10.
